# Improvements and Fixes

## 1. Environment Variable Management & Security

**Problem:** Original project had hardcoded API keys in `config.py`, creating a security risk.

**Solution:**
- Created `.env` file to store sensitive credentials
- Created `.gitignore` file to prevent API keys from being exposed in version control
- Refactored `config.py` to load environment variables using `python-dotenv`
- Added validation to ensure required API keys are set

**Benefits:** Enhanced security, follows industry best practices, prevents accidental credential exposure.
