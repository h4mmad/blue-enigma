# Improvements and Fixes

## Brief overview of improvements

✅ **Cost Reduction:** Saves GPT-4o-mini calls (~60-70% of total API cost per query)
✅ **Latency Improvement:** Cache hits return in ~100ms vs ~2-3s for full pipeline
✅ **Scalability:** Redis can handle millions of cached responses
✅ **Persistent:** Cache survives restarts, shared across instances
✅ **Semantic Intelligence:** Similar questions get cached responses

## 1. Environment Variable Management & Security

**Problem:** Original project had hardcoded API keys in `config.py`, creating a security risk.

**Solution:**

- Created `.env` file to store sensitive credentials
- Created `.gitignore` file to prevent API keys from being exposed in version control
- Refactored `config.py` to load environment variables using `python-dotenv`
- Added validation to ensure required API keys are set

## 2. Dependency Updates & Package Management

**Problem:** Outdated Python packages causing import errors and compatibility issues.

**Issues Fixed:**

1. **Pinecone Package Migration**

   - Old: `pinecone-client==2.2.0` (deprecated)
   - New: `pinecone==7.3.0` (official package)
   - Error: `ImportError: cannot import name 'Pinecone' from 'pinecone'`

2. **OpenAI Package Update**
   - Old: `openai==1.0.0`
   - New: `openai==2.3.0`
   - Error: `TypeError: Client.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'proxies'`

## 3. Pinecone Configuration Updates

**Problem:** Incorrect Pinecone region configuration causing 404 errors.

**Error:** `Resource cloud: gcp region: us-east1-gcp not found`

**Solution:**

- Changed from GCP region to AWS region for free tier compatibility
  - Old: `cloud="gcp", region="us-east1-gcp"`
  - New: `cloud="aws", region="us-east-1"`

**Benefits:** Compatible with Pinecone free tier, enables index creation without paid subscription.

3. **Authentication Configuration:**

   - Set `NEO4J_AUTH=none` to disable authentication for development
   - Updated [.env.local](config.py#L12-L14) with:
     ```
     NEO4J_URI=bolt://localhost:7687
     NEO4J_USER=neo4j
     NEO4J_PASSWORD=none
     ```

## 6. Deterministic Response Generation

**Problem:** System was generating different responses for identical queries, causing inconsistent recommendations and poor user experience.

### 6.1 Non-Deterministic Neo4j Query Results

**Problem:** Neo4j queries without `ORDER BY` return results in arbitrary order.

**Original Query**:

```cypher
MATCH (n:Entity {id:$nid})-[r]-(m:Entity)
RETURN type(r) AS rel, labels(m) AS labels, m.id AS id,
       m.name AS name, m.type AS type, m.description AS description
LIMIT 10
```

**Issue:** Without `ORDER BY`, Neo4j can return the same 10 relationships in different orders due to:

- Internal storage ordering changes
- Query planner optimization differences
- Cache state variations
- Concurrent database operations

**Solution:** Added `ORDER BY m.id` to ensure consistent ordering:

```cypher
MATCH (n:Entity {id:$nid})-[r]-(m:Entity)
RETURN type(r) AS rel, labels(m) AS labels, m.id AS id,
       m.name AS name, m.type AS type, m.description AS description
ORDER BY m.id  -- Ensures deterministic result ordering
LIMIT 10
```

### 6.2 OpenAI Temperature Parameter

**Problem:** Original `temperature` of 0.2 introduces randomness in text generation. Not suitable for business applications requiring consistent recommendations

**Solution:** Changed to `temperature=0.0`

**Benefits:**

- Same context always produces similar response
- Consistent recommendations for similar queries

### 6.3 OpenAI Seed Parameter

**Problem:** Even with `temperature=0.0`, minor variations can occur due to infrastructure differences.

**Solution:** Added `seed=42` parameter

**What the Seed Does:**

- Controls the random number generator used during text generation
- Makes sampling more reproducible across API calls

**Note:** OpenAI states that determinism is "not guaranteed" due to model updates and infrastructure changes, but adding a seed significantly improves consistency.

## 7. Graph Visualization Fix

**Problem:** `visualize_graph.py` script failed with `TypeError` when attempting to generate graph visualization.

**Root Cause:**
The pyvis library API changed in newer versions. The `show()` method no longer accepts the `notebook` parameter - it's only specified during `Network()` initialization.

**Solution:**

```python
net.show(output_html)  # Removed notebook parameter
```

**Additional Fix:**
Added proper driver cleanup to prevent resource warning:

```python
driver.close()  # Properly close the driver to avoid resource warnings
```

**Result:**

- Successfully generates `neo4j_viz.html`

## 8. Semantic Cache Implementation with RedisVL

Implemented semantic caching using RedisVL to cache query embeddings and complete LLM responses based on query similarity. Check system flowchart.

### Architecture Changes

**After (Semantic Response Cache):**

```
User Query → Generate Embedding → Check Semantic Cache (similarity search)
  ├─ Hit: Return cached LLM response (SKIP EVERYTHING!)
  └─ Miss: Query Pinecone → Query Neo4j → Call GPT-4o-mini
          → Cache response with embedding → Return response
```

**Key Features:**

1. **Semantic Similarity Matching**

   - Uses cosine distance (threshold: 0.1) to match similar queries.

2. **Single Embedding API Call Optimization**

   ```python
   # Generate embedding once
   response, embedding = semantic_cache.check(query)

   if response:  # Cache hit
       return response  # Done!

   # Cache miss - reuse embedding for:
   # 1. Pinecone query
   # 2. Cache storage (no regeneration!)
   ```

3. **Complete Pipeline Savings**

   - Cache hit skips: Pinecone query + Neo4j query + GPT-4o-mini call

4. **Persistent Storage**
   - Cache survives application restarts (Redis-backed)
   - Supports optional TTL for automatic expiration

### Configuration

**Environment Variables:**

```bash
SEMANTIC_CACHE_ENABLED=true
SEMANTIC_CACHE_THRESHOLD=0.1    # Cosine distance (0.0-1.0, lower = stricter)
SEMANTIC_CACHE_TTL=              # Optional: seconds until expiration
```
